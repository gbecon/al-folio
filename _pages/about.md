I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Ahmedabad University. I have a PhD in Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India. My doctoral dissertation explores the political economy of trade and environmental policies, highlighting the role of lobbying in shaping policy decisions.

My research interests broadly reside in environmental economics, political economy, and development, spanning issues on how political incentives, governance, and institutional quality shape development outcomes.



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
